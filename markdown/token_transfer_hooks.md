Imagine you're playing a game with your friends, and every time you give a toy to someone, there's a special rule that says you need to follow some extra stepsâ€”maybe check if they have enough room for the toy or if they can really accept it.

**Token Transfer Hooks** on Solana are like those extra rules. Normally, when you send a token (like a special coin) to someone else, it just moves from your pocket to theirs. But with **Token Transfer Hooks**, something special happens each time you transfer a token. The token program can check or do something extra before the token is transferred.

For example, the program could:
- Make sure the person you're sending the token to has enough space for it.
- Add a note to the transfer, like a "_memo_" explaining why you sent it.
- Check that both you and the other person are allowed to trade this token.

In short, **Token Transfer Hooks** let you add extra checks or actions every time a token is transferred, making sure everything follows special rules!

**Token Transfer Hooks** on Solana can be used for a variety of purposes, such as enforcing certain conditions or requirements for token transfers, triggering smart contracts or other actions, or enabling the creation of more complex and flexible token systems.

Token creators may need more control over how their token is transferred. The most prominent use case revolves around NFT royalties. Whenever a token is moved, the creator should be entitled to royalties, but due to the design of the current token program, it's impossible to stop a transfer at the protocol level.

During transfer, Token-2022 calls into the program with the accounts specified at a well-defined program-derived address for that mint and program id. This call happens after all other transfer logic, so the accounts reflect the _end_ state of the transfer.

When interacting with a transfer-hook program, it's possible to send an instruction - such as `Execute` (transfer) - to the program with only the accounts required for the `Transfer` instruction, and any extra accounts that the program may require are automatically resolved on-chain! This process is explained in detail in many of the linked `README` files below under **Resources**.
