# Solana Token Extensions (Tokens Transfer Hooks)

Token creators may need more control over how their token is transferred. The most prominent use case revolves around NFT royalties. Whenever a token is moved, the creator should be entitled to royalties, but due to the design of the current token program, it's impossible to stop a transfer at the protocol level.

During transfer, Token-2022 calls into the program with the accounts specified at a well-defined program-derived address for that mint and program id. This call happens after all other transfer logic, so the accounts reflect the _end_ state of the transfer.

When interacting with a transfer-hook program, it's possible to send an instruction - such as `Execute` (transfer) - to the program with only the accounts required for the `Transfer` instruction, and any extra accounts that the program may require are automatically resolved on-chain! This process is explained in detail in many of the linked `README` files below under **Resources**.

## Install & launch...

### Install

If not previously done...

```bash
cd token_transfer_hooks
anchor b
npm i chai
code .
```
### Launch

All the operation can been made on a **local node validator** instead of devnet, because of aidrop problems...

By running `solana-test-validator` !

> ⚠️ Beware it creates local files and directories at the current working directory.

If you choose to use it in **local**, you have to launch in **another terminal** the node validator:

```bash
solana-test-validator --reset
```

```bash
anchor t
```

## Tokens Transfer Hooks with Token Extensions on Solana

Imagine you're playing a game with your friends, and every time you give a toy to someone, there's a special rule that says you need to follow some extra steps—maybe check if they have enough room for the toy or if they can really accept it.

**Token Transfer Hooks** on Solana are like those extra rules. Normally, when you send a token (like a special coin) to someone else, it just moves from your pocket to theirs. But with **Token Transfer Hooks**, something special happens each time you transfer a token. The token program can check or do something extra before the token is transferred.

For example, the program could:
- Make sure the person you're sending the token to has enough space for it.
- Add a note to the transfer, like a "_memo_" explaining why you sent it.
- Check that both you and the other person are allowed to trade this token.

### Summary:
In short, **Token Transfer Hooks** let you add extra checks or actions every time a token is transferred, making sure everything follows special rules!

**Token Transfer Hooks** on Solana can be used for a variety of purposes, such as enforcing certain conditions or requirements for token transfers, triggering smart contracts or other actions, or enabling the creation of more complex and flexible token systems.


## Code explaination

The code for **Token Transfer Hooks** is the illustration of this **[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsduWRtT3r8)** made by **[Jonas Hahn](https://x.com/SolPlay_jonas)**


You will find here the **[Video transcription](./transcription_hook_video.md)** of this tutorial


### Summary

This code and video demonstrate various basic examples and use cases of **token transfer hooks**. These include a "Hello World" setup, error handling, transfer counters, ownership management, and whitelist implementation.

Starting from a [basic Anchor project](https://beta.solpg.io/github.com/solana-developers/anchor-transfer-hook/tree/hello_world), the examples are executed and tested via an external TypeScript program triggered through Anchor tests, showcasing practical integration and functionality.
